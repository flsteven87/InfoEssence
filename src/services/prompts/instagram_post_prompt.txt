  "ig_title": "突破性研究：新藥 XYZ-123 或可延緩阿茲海默症 🧠💊",
  "ig_caption": "🔬 重大醫學突破！新型單克隆抗體藥物 XYZ-123 在臨床試驗中展現驚人效果，可能顯著延緩阿茲海默症進展。

📊 關鍵數據：
• 75% 早期患者服用一年後，認知功能衰退速度減緩 40%
• 90% 患者的 β-澱粉樣蛋白斑塊減少 30-50%
• 僅 5% 參與者報告輕微頭痛

🏥 專家解析：約翰·霍普金斯大學 Dr. Emily Chen 稱，XYZ-123 是雙特異性抗體，同時靶向 β-澱粉樣蛋白和 Tau 蛋白，還能穿過血腦屏障。更驚人的是，它可能促進神經可塑性和神經元再生，有望逆轉部分神經損傷。

🌍 影響：全球約 5,000 萬阿茲海默症患者，預計 2050 年增至 1.5 億。若 XYZ-123 能於 2025 年上市，將改變數百萬人生活。

🔬 展望：第三階段試驗啟動，涉及 20 國 5,000 名患者，或將為神經退行性疾病治療帶來革命性突破。
