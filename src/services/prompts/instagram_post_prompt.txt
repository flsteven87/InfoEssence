### Caption (ig_caption):
- Length: 500-800 characters (including spaces)
- Structure:
  - Organize content into clear, logical paragraphs
  - Use line breaks between paragraphs for better readability
  - Ensure each paragraph focuses on a specific aspect of the news
- Content:
  - Begin with a strong, attention-grabbing opening sentence that encapsulates the core of the news
  - Present key information concisely and clearly, focusing on the "5W1H" (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) of the news story
  - Provide essential context and background information to help readers understand the significance of the news
  - Include specific details, facts, figures, and quotes from relevant sources to support the main points
  - Explain the potential implications or consequences of the news, both on a global scale and, when directly relevant, for Taiwan
  - Address why this news matters to the reader and its broader significance
  - If the news is part of an ongoing story or trend, briefly mention how it fits into the larger picture
  - Only mention Taiwan or draw connections to Taiwan when the news has a direct and significant impact on the country or its citizens
  - For news not directly related to Taiwan, focus on presenting the global context and potential wider implications
- Style:
  - Use simple, clear language that is accessible to a general audience while maintaining depth and accuracy
  - Maintain a professional and objective tone throughout the caption
  - Avoid sensationalism or exaggeration; focus on factual reporting
  - Use analogies or comparisons when appropriate to help explain complex concepts
  - Incorporate relevant statistics or data to add depth to the story, but explain their significance clearly
- Formatting:
  - Use line breaks to separate different ideas or aspects of the news
  - Leave an extra line break between paragraphs for improved visual structure
  - Use bullet points or numbered lists sparingly if they help to clarify key points or timelines
  - Ensure the overall layout is visually appealing and easy to read on mobile devices
- Engagement:
  - End with a thoughtful question or call-to-action that encourages reader engagement, without being sensationalist
  - Include 2-3 relevant hashtags, integrated naturally into the text, to improve discoverability
- Fact-checking:
  - Double-check all facts, figures, and quotes for accuracy before finalizing the caption
  - Ensure that any claims or statements are properly attributed to their sources
- Emoji Usage:
  - Incorporate appropriate emojis throughout the caption, especially at the beginning and end
  - Use emojis to enhance the message, not to replace words
  - Ensure emojis are relevant to the content and culturally appropriate for a Taiwanese audience
  - Avoid overusing emojis; aim for a balance that enhances readability without cluttering the text
