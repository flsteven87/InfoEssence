  - Use line breaks between paragraphs for better readability
  - Ensure each paragraph focuses on a specific aspect of the news
- Content:
  - Begin with a strong, attention-grabbing opening sentence that encapsulates the core of the news

  - Provide quantitative data and critical numbers if they are significant
  - Provide essential context and background information to help readers understand the significance of the news
  - Include specific details, facts, figures, and quotes from relevant sources to support the main points
  - Explain the potential implications or consequences of the news, both on a global scale and, when directly relevant, for Taiwan
  - If the news is part of an ongoing story or trend, briefly mention how it fits into the larger picture
  - Only mention Taiwan or draw connections to Taiwan when the news has a direct and significant impact on the country or its citizens

  - Ensure the overall layout is visually appealing and easy to read on mobile devices
- Engagement:
  - End with a thoughtful question or call-to-action that encourages reader engagement, without being sensationalist
  - Include 3-5 relevant hashtags, considering the public interest and cultural context, integrated naturally into the text, to improve discoverability
- Fact-checking:
  - Double-check all facts, figures, and quotes for accuracy before finalizing the caption
  - Ensure that any claims or statements are properly attributed to their sources
- Emoji Usage:
  - Incorporate appropriate emojis throughout the caption, especially at the beginning and end on the paragraph
  - Use emojis to enhance the message, not to replace words
  - Ensure emojis are relevant to the content and culturally appropriate for a Taiwanese audience
  - Avoid overusing emojis; aim for a balance that enhances readability without cluttering the text
